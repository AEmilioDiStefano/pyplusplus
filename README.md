#pyplusplus

The PyPlusPlus library was created to facilitate the C++ learning process for Python programmers by mimicing common functions in Python for use in C++ programs.

Use this as training wheels, but not as a crutch.  In other words, use this as you start getting comfortable but don't let anyone see using it.  By the time you have gotten more comfortable coding in C++ and start writing programs in a professional setting, you should be writing your own custom functions for these simple purposes rather than depending on this library.

ENJOY!
