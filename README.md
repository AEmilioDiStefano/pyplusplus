#pyplusplus

The PyPlusPlus library is meant to facilitate the C++ learning process for Python programmers by mimicing common functions in Python for use in C++ programs.

This library should be used as training wheels but not as a crutch!  When you feel comfortable coding in C++ with this library, get into the habit of writing your own functions or using existing C++ functions.
